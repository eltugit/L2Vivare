# Vote System Information
#---------------------------------------------

This vote reward system works like the well known .getreward command which is used by populated servers but includes a few improvements.

There's voting panel, with basic information about the voting process and the rewards
It's possible to give unlimited rewards and each of them to have its own chance.
It can now check up to 5 topsite's using API connections. API connections are more safe, not CPU consuming and returns in real time if the player voted.

The main advantage of this system is that players will not known which topsites we check to validate that they really voted.
This means we can add as many voting banners as we like and in addition we will only check >5 of them.
Our vote reward can check if a player voted on gamebytes.net, topzone , hopzone, l2network and l2top.co
